# LDA Prediction and Visualization Scripts for Abstract and README Data

Tere are two scripts for predicting topics and visualizing results using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models trained on abstract and README data. These scripts enable topic analysis and visualization of textual data.


## Requirements

Both scripts require the following dependencies:

* Python 3.x
* `sklearn` library for LDA model prediction
* `nltk` library for text preprocessing and tokenization
* `pyLDAvis` library for interactive topic visualizations

Make sure to install these dependencies before running the scripts.
